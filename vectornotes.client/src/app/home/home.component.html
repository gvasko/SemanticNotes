    <article>
      <p>This is a simple note-taking application with a twist: it's <em>semantic</em>. That means the app can detect similarities between notes based on their content—almost as if it understands the meaning behind the text.</p>
      <p>The main goal is to explore whether a language detection approach can also hint at the topic of a note.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the project serves as a hands-on introduction to foundational concepts in modern AI, such as high-dimensional vector representations. The implementation is intentionally simplified and not scientifically rigorous—its purpose is to offer an accessible starting point for learning and experimentation.</p>

    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <article>
      <p>After logging in, head over to the <em>Notes</em> tab to start creating your notes. These are the texts the app will use to measure similarity. Notes can be grouped into <em>collections</em>, which lets you experiment with different sets of texts.</p>
      <p>Each note can also have <em>tags</em>, which are simple name-value pairs. Tags let you describe a note with extra context—like the language it's written in or the topic it covers.</p>
      <p>You can open any note in <em>browser mode</em>, where the app will show its 10 most similar notes based on content. You'll also see their tags, helping you understand what the current note is most related to.</p>
      <p>A typical workflow is to create a <em>reference collection</em> filled with known texts and carefully tag them. Then, when you add a new note, you can compare it against the reference set to get a sense of its language or topic—based purely on content similarity.</p>
      <p>In the <em>Map</em> tab, you'll find a simple visualization that places notes closer together when they’re more similar. Keep in mind that this is just a basic algorithm for intuition—it’s not designed for high-dimensional accuracy, but may give a helpful visual overview.</p>

      <h3>Possible Further Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Smarter Visualization:</b>
        High-dimensional data is tricky to display in two dimensions. A better approach—like the one described in L. van der Maaten’s “Visualizing High-Dimensional Data using t-SNE”—could help make groupings and relationships between notes easier to see.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Adjustable Alphabet Size:</b>
        Right now, the underlying "alphabet" used to generate vectors has 5,000 dimensions. It would be interesting to test how the app behaves with smaller or larger dimensional spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Progress Indicators:</b>
        Creating language vectors can take some time, especially for multiple notes. A simple loading or progress indicator would help users understand what’s happening in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Starter Content for New Users:</b>
        To explore the app’s features, users need to create a reference collection, which takes some effort. Pre-filled example notes and collections could make onboarding smoother.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Expanded Login Options:</b>
        At the moment, you can log in using a Microsoft or Google account. Adding more login providers or support for anonymous usage might improve accessibility.
