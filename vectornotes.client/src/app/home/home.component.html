  <h2>Semantic Notes</h2>
  <p>This is a simple note taking application. The word 'semantic' means that the application can find similarities between notes based on their content.</p>
  <p>The goal of this application is to see if a language detector approach can detect the topic as well.</p>
  <p>It is also a goal to have a starting point to understand some very basic concepts in modern AI, like high-dimensional representations. Therefore the implementation is not entirely correct and not scientific, it is only for building some basic understanding.</p>
  <p>
    The implementation is based on the following references:

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>After logging in, you can create notes, navigate to the Notes tab. These will be the texts used for similarity calculation. Notes can be organized into collections, so you can experiment with different sets of texts.</p>
  <p>Each note can have tags. A tag is a name-value pair, so you can decorate a text with its attributes, like what language it is written in or what topic it represents.</p>
  <p>You can open a note in browser mode, where its 10 most similar notes are listed, and their tags are also shown, so you can see what the currently selected note (or text) is like.</p>
  <p>The recommended usage is to create at least a collection that contains the reference texts, add their tags that describe them and use this reference collection on any other note to detect what a custom text is like most, e.g. what is its language or topic.</p>
  <p>Using the Map tab, a visualisation is provided based on the level of similarity, so the more similar the texts, the closer they should be. Unfortunately this algorithm is just a quick common sense one which does not work well in many dimensions.</p>

  <h2>Possible Further Improvements</h2>
  <p>Apply L. van der Maaten. “Visualizing high-dimensional data using t-SNE” for better visualisation, referenced in [2].</p>
